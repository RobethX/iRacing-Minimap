# UPDATE
I've indefinitely shelved this project because I found a program that functions exactly as planned this one to: https://joel-real-timing.com/trackmap_en.html
# iRacing-Minimap
A Python project that (in theory) adds a minimap to iRacing that shows important information like where to turn in and how long to break.

Made with Python 3.5.2

Required modules:
=======
	pyyaml
	pyirsdk
	tkinter
